# DevOps Portfolio

Welcome to the **DevOps Portfolio** project! This is a static web application built using **React** and **Vite**, showcasing a portfolio with a focus on DevOps practices. The project leverages modern DevOps tools and AI-driven development to create a dynamic and scalable portfolio website.

This project is hosted on [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/5e6bc878-5f2c-4ac8-aff5-d64bce42a41f) and serves as a demonstration of integrating DevOps tools like Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes into a development workflow.

## Features
- **Static Web Application**: Built with React and Vite for fast performance and modern JavaScript features.
- **DevOps Integration**: Incorporates Git for version control, Jenkins for CI/CD, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **AI-Driven Development**: Utilizes AI tools via Lovable for efficient code generation and updates.
- **Customizable**: Easily editable through Lovable, GitHub, or local IDEs.
- **Scalable**: Designed to support future enhancements like dynamic content and cloud deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - Vite: Fast build tool for modern web projects.
  - TypeScript: Type-safe JavaScript for robust code.
  - React: Component-based UI library.
  - shadcn-ui: Reusable UI components.
  - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **DevOps Tools**:
  - Git: Version control system.
  - GitHub: Code hosting and collaboration platform.
  - Jenkins: Continuous integration and deployment tool.
  - Docker: Containerization platform for consistent environments.
  - Kubernetes: Container orchestration for scalable deployments.
